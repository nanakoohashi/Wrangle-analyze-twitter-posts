## Wrangle and Visualize Twitter Posts
Wrangle the data, analyze the data, and visualize a tweet archive dataset.

## Description
The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. My task is to wrangle the data, analyze the data, and visualize the data.
